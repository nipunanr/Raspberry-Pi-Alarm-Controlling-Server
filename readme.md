# NR IOT Device Control System

This is a Python script that implements an IoT device control system using a Raspberry Pi. The script controls LEDs and buzzers connected to GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. It also interacts with a MySQL database to log device runs and trigger alerts.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure the following:

- You have a Raspberry Pi device with the required hardware components (LEDs, buzzers).
- Python is installed on your Raspberry Pi.
- The required Python packages are installed. You can install them using the following commands:

    ```bash
    pip install gpiozero mysql-connector-python art
    ```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi.

2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```

4. The script will initialize the device, establish a connection to the database, and start an HTTP server to handle requests.

## Configuration

### Device Configuration

- Modify the `device_ip` variable to specify the IP address of the Raspberry Pi.

### Pins Configuration

- Update the `led_pin` and `buzzer_pin` variables to set the GPIO pins for the LED and buzzer respectively.

### Database Configuration

- Update the `db_host`, `db_name`, `db_user`, and `db_password` variables to connect to your MySQL database.

## API Endpoints

- `/`: Displays a simple message.

- `/trigger`: Accepts POST requests with JSON data to control device alerts.

    - Send a POST request with JSON data:
    
        ```json
        {
            "location": "your_device_location",
            "notification": "on"  // or "off"
        }
        ```
